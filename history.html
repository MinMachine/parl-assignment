    <h1>Pioneer Group of Schools</h1>
    
    <p> 
        Our roots as Pioneer Group of Schools date back to 1996 when it was established on a former colonial sisal farm and factory along the ridges of Maragua river in Muranga District, formerly Central Province; the traditional center of the Kikuyu plateau. The academic institution began by providing primary school education under the 8-4-4 system (Class 4 to Class 8) with around 100 pupils.
        
        Throughout its history it has been one of the leading independent schools in Kenya and it continues to provide a stimulating all-round education, coupled with academic excellence.
        
        Ours is a modern, forward-thinking school which embraces new opportunities within teaching and learning with focus on Science Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education. Tradition teaching remains important and still shapes some of our guiding principles, but it is our willingness to innovate which has seen the schools thrive.
